title: Tennent’s Principle of Correspondence
---

After watching the incredibly insightful [Adventures in Functional Programming](https://vimeo.com/45140590) I was intrigued by the different refactoring tools he used to arrive at the Y Combinator.

The first of which was Tennent’s Principle of Correspondence.  In my research I’ve found two different explanations of it.  First from [Neal Gafter’s Blog](http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/08/tennents-correspondence-principle-and.html): “The principle dictates that an expression or statement, when wrapped in a closure and then immediately invoked, ought to have the same meaning as it did before being wrapped in a closure.”

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log("Printed!");
 
(function() {
  console.log("Printed!");
}());
{% endhighlight %}

Second from [Techscursion](http://techscursion.com/2012/02/tennent-correspondence-principle.html), “for any parameter mechanism, an analogous definition mechanism is possible, and vice versa.”

{% highlight javascript %}
var incr = (function() {
  var n = 0; //Definition mechanism
  return function() {
    return n++;
  };
}());
 
var incr = (function(n) { //Parameter mechanism
    return function() {
       return n++;
    };
}(0));
{% endhighlight %}

They both seem rather silly in such simple contexts, but they give you a good way to functionally express things in JavaScript. As an exercise, I converted a pretty simple Curry function:

{% highlight javascript %}
//Imperative
Function.prototype.curry = function() {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments),
      fn = this;
 
  return function() {
    var innerArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    return fn.apply(this, args.concat(innerArgs));
  }
}
 
//Tennentive
Function.prototype.curry = function() {
  return (function(args, fn) {
    return function() {
      return (function (innerArgs, context) {
        return fn.apply(context, args.concat(innerArgs));
      })(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments), this);
    }
  })(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments), this);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## What About Performance?
Now I was curious, is there a performance difference between the two implementations?  Here’s a jsperf to examine the performance currying and of calling the curried function: [Imperative vs Functional](https://jsperf.com/curry-imperative-vs-imperativ/2).

As of writing this, I ran the test 10 times each in Chrome 20, Firefox 10 and IE 9.

**Chrome 20:**

* Imperative Currying was about 8% faster than Functional
* Calling the curried function was nearly identical.
* Overall the performance was more than double the others

**Firefox 10:**

* Functional Currying was actually almost 4% faster
* Calling the imperatively curried function was 11% faster though.

**IE 9:**

* Functional Currying was a whopping 33% faster in IE 9
* Calling the imperatively curried function was, once again, 11% faster.

## This and Return

There’s a few sort of wonky workarounds you have to manage in certain situations.  Yehuda Katz covers the issues around this and return in his article [JavaScript Needs Blocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20131206220334/http://yehudakatz.com/2012/01/10/javascript-needs-blocks/).  You can see how I had to handle them in my Tennentive version, extra returns and binding this to a parameter.

{% highlight javascript %}
Function.prototype.curry = function() {
  //Extra return to pass on return of anonymous function
  return (function(args, fn) {
    return function() {
      //Extra return to pass on return of anonymous function
      return (function (innerArgs, context) {
        return fn.apply(context, args.concat(innerArgs));
      })(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments), this); //Bind this to an argument
    }
  })(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments), this); //Bind this to an argument
}
{% endhighlight %}
