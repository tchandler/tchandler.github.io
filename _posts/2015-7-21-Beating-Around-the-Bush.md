title: Beating Around the Bush
---

I felt that the gauntlet laid before my by my new job was too big and interesting to go undocumented.  That being said, for a while at least, there's going to be some equivocating while we work sort of undercover.  I'll try to discuss the technical details, small problems, and things I learn as much as possible, but I'm going to avoid publishing anything that discusses the big picture for a while.

This is a Jekyll blog that I'll probably be tweaking over time.  Pretty much every other blogging platform I've used had felt really heavy to use and I was always fighting with formatting.  Inserting dynamic content and syntax highlighting always required much more effort than seemed necessary.  For this blog's syntax highlighting styles, I'm going with [Demitri Moore's Syntax CSS](https://demisx.github.io/jekyll/2014/01/13/improve-code-highlighting-in-jekyll.html).  It'll also be much easier to embed content via HTML than having to go the route of fighting a wysiwig editor's insistence on *fixing* my edits to the HTML.
