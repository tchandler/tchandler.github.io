## [Nostalgeist](http://www.nostalgeist.com) ##
Create playlists from a random week in a [last.fm](last.fm) user's history. Optionally the list can be exported to Spotify. Simple tool built with Python and hosted on Heroku. [source](https://www.github.com/tchandler/Nostalgeist)

## [AuDOMio](/AuDOMio) ##
Bookmarklet that allows you to listen to websites. Using the structure of the page and characteristics of the page's title and url, a song-like set of sounds is produced. Uses [music.js](https://github.com/gregjopa/music.js) for frequency mapping notes and scales, and [Audiolet](https://github.com/oampo/Audiolet) for sound synchronization and generation.

## [Simulacrum](/Simulacrum) ##
An abstract, simulated ecosystem using a customized version of Flora.js. Two interdependent species (orange and blue) of [Braitenberg vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle) that eat, metabolise, reproduce, and die. Each species consumes a naturally occuring resource as well as a resource that the other produces as waste. An experiment in balancing the rules of a system to be resillient against random starts.

## [Eventworks](https://github.com/tchandler/Eventworks)
A channeled pub sub system that I wrote to experiment with event based systems and various JS patterns.

## [FireStarter](/FireStarter) ##
An experiment with Canvas, a grid of growing green blocks that can be burnt down. The fire spreads however, so if you aren't careful, the entire grid could burn down.
